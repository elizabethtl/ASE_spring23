# HW4 documentation

goal of hw4 is to convert

to my own [code](../src/hw4/).

I collected three repgrids on TV shows and thier various characteristics.

I collected 6 TV shows and 6 pairs of characteristics from the first person. 
Then had them produce the ratings for the repgrid.
For the second person, I asked them for 6 TV shows and 6 pairs of characteristics. 
The second person produced a repgrid for the 6 TV shows they thought of and also for 3 they picked from the first person, using the characteristics they came up with.
For the third person, I repeated what was done for the second person.

[repgrid1 for TV shows](../etc/data/my_repgrid2.csv)
[repgrid2 for TV shows](../etc/data/my_repgrid3.csv)
[repgrid3 for TV shows](../etc/data/my_repgrid4.csv)

[output1 for TV show repgrid](../etc/out/hw4-2.out)
[output2 for TV show repgrid](../etc/out/hw4-3.out)
[output3 for TV show repgrid](../etc/out/hw4-4.out)

From the outputs of running the repgrids through the program, we are able to see which TV shows are similar to our interviewees.
The top characteristics that separate TV shows are whether they plot included a lot of suspense, whether there was a comedic effect, and whether different seasons had a connection to each other. Whether a show is realistic or not did not seem to have a huge effect on the results.
